$ # Disable collect static 
$ heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1
$
$ # Push the source code and trigger the deploy
$ git push heroku master
$
$ # Execute DBSchema Migration
$ heroku run python manage.py makemigrations
$ heroku run python manage.py migrate
$
$ # Visit the deployed app in browser.
$ heroku open
